Below are a list of 10 products which cover the majority of CCCM output requirements.
### 1. 3W (Who, What, Where)
[![3W](C:/Users/bmcdonald/OneDrive - International Organization for Migration - IOM/Code/CCCM-Cluster-Analysis-Playbook/site/images/3W.png)](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/20171229_4w_final.pdf)
**Name Variations:** 4W, Operational Presence Map
**Purpose:** To identify what agencies (who) are delivering what services (what), in which locations (where).
**Data sources & requirements:** In some contexts it’s done in collaboration with OCHA with data coming from partners. In cases such as Bangladesh it’s gathered from the DTM/NPM (both service availability & agency presence.
GIS data should be available from OCHA[^1] or on [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/)
**Specificity:** Either admin level or site-level depending on available data and assessment type.
**Limitations/Variations:** The 4th W referes to 'When'. This can be gathered from adding project dataes to the data or by doing snapshots over time. The former approach may add unnescessary complexity/reporting burnden.  3W/4Ws can be collected both from partners and/or through site assessments. Both approaches have their pros and cons.
**Usage:** All cluster countries should have a 3W
**Examples:** [Bangladesh](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/20171229_4w_final.pdf)
