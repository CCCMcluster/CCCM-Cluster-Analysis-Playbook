![3W](/images/3W.png)  
**Name Variations:** 4W, Operational Presence Map  
**Purpose:** To identify what agencies (who) are delivering what services (what), in which locations (where).  
**Data sources & requirements:** In some contexts it’s done in collaboration with OCHA with data coming from partners. In cases such as Bangladesh it’s gathered from the DTM/NPM (both service availability & agency presence.  
GIS data should be available from OCHA[^1] or on [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/)  
**Specificity:** Either admin level or site-level depending on available data and assessment type. 
**Limitations/Variations:** The 4th W referes to 'When'. This can be gathered from adding project dataes to the data or by doing snapshots over time. The former approach may add unnescessary complexity/reporting burnden.  3W/4Ws can be collected both from partners and/or through site assessments. Both approaches have their pros and cons.  
**Usage:** All cluster countries should have a 3W
