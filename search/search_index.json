In cases such as Bangladesh it\u2019s gathered from the DTM/NPM (both service availability & agency presence. GIS data should be available from OCHA 1 or on HDX 2 Specificity: Either admin level or site-level depending on available data and assessment type. Limitations/Variations: The 4th W referes to 'When'. This can be gathered from adding project dataes to the data or by doing snapshots over time. The former approach may add unnescessary complexity/reporting burnden. 3W/4Ws can be collected both from partners and/or through site assessments. Both approaches have their pros and cons.
